# Story of the Dataset and Its Analysis: A Journey Through Global Well-being

## Introduction

In the quest to understand the intricacies of global well-being, a rich dataset comprising 2,363 rows and 11 columns was received. This dataset encapsulates various aspects affecting happiness and quality of life across 165 countries from the years 2005 to 2023. The variables analyzed include the "Life Ladder," which indicates overall well-being, along with factors like GDP per capita, social support, freedom of choice, and both positive and negative affect measures.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. **Country name**: The name of the country (categorical).
2. **Year**: The year of the observation (numerical).
3. **Life Ladder**: A subjective measure of well-being from 0 to 10 (numerical).
4. **Log GDP per capita**: The logarithm of GDP per capita (numerical).
5. **Social support**: The perceived social support available (numerical).
6. **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Average healthy years a person can expect at birth (numerical).
7. **Freedom to make life choices**: Measure of autonomy in life choices (numerical).
8. **Generosity**: Measurement of willingness to donate and altruism (numerical).
9. **Perceptions of corruption**: Degree to which people perceive corruption in their country (numerical).
10. **Positive affect**: Frequency of positive experiences (numerical).
11. **Negative affect**: Frequency of negative experiences (numerical).

### Missing Values
Upon evaluation, certain columns had missing values:
- Log GDP per capita: 28 missing values
- Social support: 13 missing values
- Healthy life expectancy: 63 missing values
- Freedom to make life choices: 36 missing values
- Generosity: 81 missing values
- Perceptions of corruption: 125 missing values
- Positive affect: 24 missing values
- Negative affect: 16 missing values

These missing values necessitated careful handling to ensure analytical robustness.

## Analysis Performed

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
First, the missing values were addressed using imputation techniques such as mean imputation for numerical values. Categorical data remained unaffected since there were no missing entries in the country names.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Numerical data distributions were analyzed with descriptive statistics and visualizations:
- **Histograms** showed distributions of key numerical variables, indicating a relatively normal distribution for "Life Ladder" and "Log GDP per capita."
- **Box plots** were used to identify outliers, particularly in "Generosity" and "Perceptions of corruption."

### Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was constructed to identify relationships among variables. This included:
- **Heatmaps** that visually represented correlation strengths, revealing strong correlations between "Log GDP per capita" and "Life Ladder" (r = 0.64) and between "Social support" and "Life Ladder" (r = 0.67).

### Sprinkled Insights with Data Visualization
1. **Bar charts** illustrated the average "Life Ladder" across different continents, highlighting that European countries generally reported higher levels of well-being compared to those in other regions.
2. **Scatter plots** were created to visualize the relationship between GDP and well-being, demonstrating that while wealth (GDP) contributes to happiness, there are notable exceptions where social support significantly impacts well-being, regardless of income level.

## Key Insights Discovered

1. **Wealth Does Matter, But Not Alone**: While higher GDP per capita is associated with better life satisfaction, social support emerged as a more influential factor on happiness, suggesting that emotional and community resources are critical for well-being.
  
2. **Regional Differences**: Northern European countries reported average life ladder scores exceeding 6, whereas many in Sub-Saharan Africa fell below 4. This stark contrast showcases the complexities of societal well-being influenced by various environmental and social factors.

3. **The Duality of Affect**: The balance of positive and negative affect strongly correlated with overall happiness. Countries with high positive affect tended to have lower scores in negative affect, suggesting that fostering positive experiences could be key in improving overall happiness metrics.

4. **Corruption Harms Happiness**: High perceptions of corruption significantly depressed life satisfaction scores, indicating the need for transparent governance.

## Practical Implications and Recommendations

Based on these findings, several recommendations can be made for policymakers and stakeholders striving to enhance population well-being:

1. **Invest in Social Infrastructure**: Governments should prioritize funding for community programs that foster social support networks, given their significant impact on well-being.

2. **Holistic Policy Formulation**: Policies should be multi-faceted, combining economic growth initiatives with measures to reduce corruption, enhance freedoms, and improve health services.

3. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Increase awareness about the positive impact of social connections and community involvement on individual happiness can promote a culture of empowerment.

4. **Personalized Well-being Strategies**: Countries must consider diverse strategies catered to their unique cultural contexts when devising initiatives aimed at improving quality of life.

## Conclusion

In summary, this dataset presents a compelling narrative about the state of global well-being. Through rigorous analysis, we uncovered multifaceted insights that not only broaden our understanding of happiness and quality of life but also pave the way for informed decisions to foster a better global society. By embracing the complexity of happiness, we can work towards creating environments where individuals flourish holistically.
